# 1delta Unite

A Limit Order extension for the 1inhc protocol that allows using the orders for defi spot margin trading an lenders like Aave and Morpho Blue.

## Limit orders for basis trading using 1inch

Execute pre-action as composed lending operations.

100% Gasless possible for users.

Partial fils possibly included.

Many lenders supported (Aave, Morpho and Compounds).

Triggers possible in `postInteraction`.

## Contract architecture

### âœ¨ Execution flow

1) the user defines the order and lending operations (borrow and deposit in our examples)
2) setup for the user
   - they can decide to deposit the initial margin upfront, but it can also be part of the `preInteraction` (they would then only need to permit the deposit action)
   - the borrow delegation needs to be provided (either via `permit` (then it is in the `preInteraction`) or via simple `approveDelegation` call)
3) the order and extension action need to be signed (this can be abbreviated, but for simplicity we do it with 2 signatures)
4) the order and extension can be broadcast to fillers
5) **Fill**: A filler can pick it up and define a `takerInteraction` to fill the order
   - our settler will flash loan the funds (the `takerAount`) from morpho to the settler itself and call teh 1inch `fillContractOrder` function
   - beforehand, we extract the signer from the lending operation to validate the signature (we need this to ensure that the correct entity recevies the collateral and debt)
   - we call teh 1inch contract and it execute the `isValidSignature` function
   - the sttlement contract works as contract signer for users (for this cas e only) as it combines signature and expected signer (the signer from the lending operations) to be forwarded for validation
   - the settler extracts the signer from the signature and matches it
   - **Margin**: `preInteraction` is called, in our examples, this is deposit the `takingAmount` (here we need the flash loaned funds as the taker has not yet transferred anything), then borrow the `makingAmount`
   - note that the interaction now produced  the making amount without the user holding them
   - **Maker->Taker** the 1inch router can now pull the funds to fill the maker to taker transfer
   - **Taker fill without inventory**: `takerInteraction` is executed that swaps the received funds (via uniswap V3 in our case) to obtain the `takerAmount` that is pending for flash loan repayment
   - **Maker->Taker**: After the filfilment, the 1inch router executes the final token transfer that ensures that the funds indeed were received
   - **Flash settlement**: the amounts received are validated and we refund the excess (amount received from uni V3 minus falsh-repayment amount to the taker defined address) and repay the flash loan
6) The user now holds a leveraged position in Aave V3 that has bee conditionally opened and the filler fulfilled that order without holding inventory.



# ToDos

## UI
- Build limit order interface
- Get simple data provision (maybe we do Morpho B first)
- Create default sig setup using 1inch SDK to be able to sign at least default orders
- Build shell for costom data inclusion

## Contracts
- Build lending (contract) APIs with amounts (amounts cannot be encoded on actions as we want to allow partial fills)
- Define states that enables partial fills (validate call from 1inch router and store the partials based on the hash)
- build pre-defined flash loan selection that wraps the fill call (Morpho B is enough here)
- ideally: build it so that there are no additional sigs required asisde of order & lending permits

## Backend
- Build filler API
   - The filler can be a worker  with a simple KV that collects all orders
   - Just run a cron that stores and exposes the orders
   - Build a reader that reads the orders
   - build calldata that uses 1inch aggregation API and flash loan selection (default: Morpho B) to fill an order if possible
